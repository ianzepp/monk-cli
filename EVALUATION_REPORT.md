# Monk CLI Evaluation Report

## Executive Summary

This report evaluates monk-cli against two key criteria:
1. **API Coverage**: How well the CLI covers the monk-api functionality
2. **CLI Best Practices**: How monk-cli compares to popular CLI tools (gh, docker)

```

## API Coverage Analysis

### ✅ Well Covered Areas

**Core Data Operations**
- ✅ Schema CRUD (`/api/meta/schema/*`)
- ✅ Data CRUD (`/api/data/*`)
- ✅ Advanced search (`/api/find/:schema`)
- ✅ Authentication (`/auth/*`)
- ✅ Health checks (`/ping`, `/health`)

**Infrastructure Management**
- ✅ Multi-server configuration
- ✅ Multi-tenant database management
- ✅ User management (placeholder structure)

### ❌ Missing/Incomplete Areas

**1. Bulk Operations**
- API: `POST /api/bulk` - Batch operations across multiple schemas
- CLI: No equivalent command
- Impact: Users must perform individual operations

**2. Advanced Auth Features**
- API: `POST /auth/refresh` - Token refresh
- API: `GET /auth/me` - User context
- CLI: Basic auth only (login/logout/status)
- Impact: Limited token lifecycle management

### ✅ Correctly Excluded Areas

**FTP Interface (`/ftp/*`)**
- **Why excluded**: These endpoints are internal infrastructure for monk-ftp server
- **Architecture**: FTP Client → monk-ftp → monk-api `/ftp/*` endpoints
- **User access**: Already covered via `monk data` commands (better interface)
- **Conclusion**: CLI should not expose implementation details

**3. Administrative Features**
- CLI: `root` commands are placeholder implementations
- API: No dedicated admin endpoints identified
- Status: Framework exists but needs implementation

## Comparison with Popular CLI Tools

### GitHub CLI (gh) Patterns
```
gh <resource> <action> [flags]
Example: gh repo create, gh pr list, gh issue view
```

**Strengths of gh:**
- Clear resource-action pattern
- Rich flag system with filtering/formatting
- Built-in aliases and shortcuts
- Interactive modes for complex operations
- Excellent help system with examples

### Docker CLI Patterns
```
docker <resource> <action> [options]
Example: docker image ls, docker container exec
```

**Strengths of docker:**
- Hierarchical command structure
- Management commands group related operations
- Consistent option patterns across commands
- Rich output formatting options

## Monk CLI Strengths

### ✅ Good Patterns Already Implemented

1. **Clear Command Hierarchy**
   - `monk auth login` follows resource-action pattern
   - Logical grouping of related operations

2. **Multi-Environment Support**
   - Server switching with persistent configuration
   - Environment-specific configurations

3. **Configuration Management**
   - `~/.config/monk/` centralized configuration
   - `monk init` for setup simplification

4. **Advanced Search Capabilities**
   - Rich filtering with DSL
   - Multiple output formats (count, head, tail)

## Improvement Opportunities

### 1. Missing Functionality (High Priority)

**A. Bulk Operations**
```bash
# Proposed commands
monk bulk --file operations.json    # Execute bulk operations
monk bulk create users < users.json # Bulk create records
monk bulk update --filter "age>25" users < updates.json
```

**B. Enhanced Authentication**
```bash
# Proposed enhancements
monk auth refresh                   # Token refresh
monk auth whoami                    # Current user info
monk auth expire                    # Check token expiration
```

### 2. CLI Experience Improvements (Medium Priority)

**A. Output Formatting**
```bash
# Following gh/docker patterns
monk data list users --format json
monk data list users --format table
monk data list users --format csv
monk servers list --format wide
```

**B. Interactive Operations**
```bash
# Interactive prompts for complex operations
monk tenant create                  # Interactive tenant setup
monk auth login                     # Interactive server selection
monk data create users              # Interactive field input
```

**C. Aliases and Shortcuts**
```bash
# Common operation shortcuts
monk ls users                       # Alias for 'monk data list users'
monk get users 123                  # Alias for 'monk data get users 123'
monk ping-all                       # Alias for 'monk servers ping-all'
```

**D. Enhanced Help and Documentation**
```bash
# Better help with examples
monk data create --help             # Show JSON examples
monk find --help                    # Show filter DSL examples
monk help examples                  # Command usage examples
```

### 3. Advanced Features (Future Enhancement)

**A. Configuration Profiles**
```bash
monk profile create development     # Create environment profile
monk profile use development        # Switch to profile
monk profile list                   # List all profiles
```

**B. Plugin System**
```bash
monk plugin install backup         # Extensible commands
monk plugin list                    # Plugin management
```

**C. Watch Mode**
```bash
monk data watch users               # Real-time data changes
monk servers watch                  # Server status monitoring
```

## Recommended Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Critical Missing Features
1. **Bulk operations** - High user impact for data management
2. **Enhanced authentication** - Token lifecycle management

### Phase 2: User Experience
1. **Output formatting options** - Match modern CLI expectations
2. **Interactive modes** - Improve usability for complex operations
3. **Command aliases** - Improve efficiency for power users

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. **Configuration profiles** - Multi-environment workflows
2. **Watch modes** - Real-time monitoring capabilities
3. **Plugin system** - Extensibility for custom workflows

## Success Metrics

1. **API Coverage**: 100% of documented API endpoints accessible via CLI
2. **User Adoption**: CLI handles 80%+ of common API operations
3. **Developer Experience**: CLI patterns match or exceed popular tools (gh, docker)
4. **Discoverability**: All commands have comprehensive help with examples

## Conclusion

monk-cli provides excellent coverage of core API functionality with a well-structured command hierarchy. The main gap is bulk operations, which represents a significant user workflow enhancement. The FTP endpoints are correctly excluded as they serve as infrastructure for the monk-ftp server rather than direct user functionality.

The CLI follows modern patterns but could benefit from enhanced output formatting and interactive modes to match popular tools like gh and docker. Priority should be given to implementing bulk operations and enhanced authentication before focusing on user experience improvements.

**Key Insight**: CLI should expose user workflows, not internal API implementation details. The evaluation confirmed that monk-cli correctly focuses on user-facing data operations rather than infrastructure endpoints.
