# monk-cli phase 1 summary

Implemented the shared Monk API helper layer and wired the CLI command families to the helper surface.

## Delivered
- config loading/saving with env overrides
- shared reqwest client with bearer auth and response parsing
- auth helpers for login/register/refresh/sudo
- top-level command dispatch for all current command families
- basic docs/public route fetches and JSON rendering

## Notes
- Some endpoints still use placeholder request bodies; those will be refined as endpoint-specific payloads are implemented.
- `cargo check` and `cargo fmt --check` pass after formatting.

## Validation
- `cargo check`
- `cargo fmt --check`
