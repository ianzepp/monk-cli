# bulk_status_command.sh - Check status of async bulk operation (FUTURE FEATURE)
#
# This command will check the processing status of a submitted bulk operation
# and return progress information, estimated completion time, and current state.
#
# Planned Usage:
#   monk bulk status bulk-12345
#   # Returns: {"operation_id": "bulk-12345", "status": "processing", "progress": "450/1000", "eta": "2min"}
#
# Status States:
#   - submitted: Operation queued, waiting to start
#   - processing: Currently executing operations  
#   - completed: All operations finished successfully
#   - failed: Operation failed with errors
#   - cancelled: Operation was cancelled by user
#
# Progress Information:
#   - Total operation count and completed count
#   - Estimated time remaining based on current throughput
#   - Success/error breakdown for completed operations
#   - Current operation being processed
#
# Planned API Endpoint:
#   GET /api/bulk/async/status/:operation_id
#   Implementation requires:
#   - Operation progress tracking in database/cache
#   - Real-time status updates from background workers
#   - Performance metrics for ETA calculations
#
# Error Handling:
#   - Invalid operation ID returns appropriate error
#   - Expired/cleaned up operations handled gracefully
#
# Current Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED
# API backend does not yet support async bulk operations

# Check dependencies

# Get arguments from bashly
