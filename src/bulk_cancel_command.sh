# bulk_cancel_command.sh - Cancel pending bulk operation (FUTURE FEATURE)
#
# This command will cancel a pending or in-progress bulk operation before completion,
# allowing users to abort long-running batch processes when needed.
#
# Planned Usage:
#   monk bulk cancel bulk-12345
#   monk bulk cancel bulk-12345 --force    # Force cancel even if partially completed
#
# Cancellation Behavior:
#   - submitted/queued operations: Immediately cancelled, no operations executed
#   - processing operations: Graceful shutdown after current operation completes
#   - completed operations: Cannot be cancelled, returns appropriate error
#   - failed operations: Marks as cancelled instead of failed for clarity
#
# Cancellation Results:
#   Returns summary of cancellation:
#   {
#     "operation_id": "bulk-12345",
#     "status": "cancelled",
#     "operations_completed": 150,
#     "operations_cancelled": 850,
#     "partial_results_available": true
#   }
#
# Safety Features:
#   - Confirmation prompt for operations with completed results
#   - Partial results preserved and downloadable
#   - Graceful shutdown prevents data corruption
#   - Audit trail maintained for cancelled operations
#
# Planned API Endpoint:
#   DELETE /api/bulk/async/:operation_id
#   Implementation requires:
#   - Background worker cancellation support
#   - Partial result preservation
#   - Operation state management
#   - Cleanup of cancelled operation resources
#
# Edge Cases:
#   - Operations that cannot be safely cancelled (mid-transaction)
#   - Already completed operations (no-op with status info)
#   - Invalid operation IDs handled gracefully
#
# Current Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED
# API backend does not yet support async bulk operations

# Check dependencies
