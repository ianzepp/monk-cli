# bulk_submit_command.sh - Submit bulk operations for async processing (FUTURE FEATURE)
#
# This command will submit bulk operations to a background processing queue
# and return an operation ID for tracking progress and retrieving results.
#
# Planned Usage:
#   cat large-operations.json | monk bulk submit
#   # Returns: {"operation_id": "bulk-12345", "status": "submitted", "count": 1000}
#
# Input Format:
#   Same as 'bulk raw' - array of operation objects with operation, schema, data, etc.
#   Designed for large operation sets that would timeout in synchronous mode
#
# Planned API Endpoints:
#   POST /api/bulk/async/submit â†’ Returns operation ID
#   Implementation requires:
#   - Background job queue (Redis/database)
#   - Operation progress tracking
#   - Result storage and retrieval system
#   - Timeout and retry handling
#
# Related Commands:
#   monk bulk status <id>   # Check processing progress
#   monk bulk result <id>   # Download completed results  
#   monk bulk cancel <id>   # Cancel pending operations
#
# Current Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED
# API backend does not yet support async bulk operations

# Check dependencies
