# bulk_result_command.sh - Download results of completed bulk operation (FUTURE FEATURE)
#
# This command will download the complete results of a finished bulk operation,
# including all operation outcomes, errors, and generated data.
#
# Planned Usage:
#   monk bulk result bulk-12345
#   monk bulk result bulk-12345 > results.json    # Save to file
#   monk bulk result bulk-12345 --errors-only     # Only failed operations
#
# Result Format:
#   Returns the original operations array with 'result' field populated for each operation:
#   [
#     {
#       "operation": "create",
#       "schema": "users", 
#       "data": {"name": "Alice"},
#       "result": {"id": "user-789", "status": "success"}
#     },
#     {
#       "operation": "update",
#       "schema": "users",
#       "id": "123", 
#       "data": {"name": "Updated"},
#       "result": {"error": "Record not found", "status": "failed"}
#     }
#   ]
#
# Result Processing:
#   - Full operation audit trail with success/failure status
#   - Generated IDs for successful create operations
#   - Detailed error messages for failed operations
#   - Performance metrics (execution time, throughput)
#   - Data integrity validation results
#
# Planned API Endpoint:
#   GET /api/bulk/async/result/:operation_id
#   Implementation requires:
#   - Result storage system (database/file storage)
#   - Result cleanup policies (TTL, size limits)
#   - Streaming download for large result sets
#
# Error Handling:
#   - Invalid operation ID returns appropriate error
#   - Results not yet ready returns status information
#   - Expired results handled with cleanup notification
#
# Current Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED
# API backend does not yet support async bulk operations

# Check dependencies
check_dependencies

# Get arguments from bashly
