# data_import_command.sh - Bulk import JSON files as records
#
# This command imports multiple JSON files from a directory as records in a schema.
# All .json files are collected into an array and sent in a single bulk API request.
#
# Usage Examples:
#   monk data import users ./backup/users/              # Import from directory
#   monk data import products /tmp/migration/           # Migration import
#
# Input Structure:
#   - Scans directory for all *.json files
#   - Each file should contain a valid JSON object (one record)
#   - Files processed in sorted order by filename
#   - All records combined into array for bulk import
#
# Requirements:
#   - Python3 required for JSON parsing and file operations
#   - Directory must exist and contain .json files
#   - Each JSON file must be valid and represent one record
#
# API Endpoint:  
#   PUT /api/data/:schema (bulk import with array payload)

# Get arguments from bashly

directory="${args[dir]}"
